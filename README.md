Nanoparticles have gained significant attention in recent years as a promising approach for drug delivery. The unique physicochemical properties of nanoparticles enable them to improve drug solubility, target specific cells or tissues, provide controlled drug release, protect drugs from degradation or elimination, and reduce toxicity to healthy cells. These advantages have made nanoparticles a valuable tool in drug delivery for a wide range of diseases. Nanoparticles can be designed to target specific cells or tissues in the body, improving drug efficacy while reducing side effects. The increased solubility of drugs facilitated by nanoparticles allows for better delivery and efficacy of drugs that have poor solubility in water. Controlled drug release from nanoparticles provides sustained drug delivery, reducing the need for frequent dosing and improving patient compliance. Furthermore, nanoparticles can protect drugs from degradation or elimination, increasing their effectiveness. Overall, the usage of nanoparticles in drug delivery systems holds great potential for improving patient outcomes and revolutionizing the field of medicine. This abstract provides an overview of the potential applications of nanoparticles in drug delivery systems[1].
